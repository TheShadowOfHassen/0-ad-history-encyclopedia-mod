History Mod:

0AD's initiative to give a historical and educational context to the game, the AoE saga also brings this feature, where AoM stands out the most.

It explains every detail, technology, building and unit.

The encyclopedia is included in the game. It gives a simple and short summary of the topics covered.

This is the updated version of the encyclopedia that used to be in the 0 A.D. revision: https://trac.wildfiregames.com/browser/ps/trunk/binaries/data/mods/public/simulation/templates/units?rev=19959&order=name

CONTRIBUTING:

We'll discuss this mod on the forum here:  
https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/107400-0-ads-built-in-encyclopedia/#comment-552231

Use <History> </History> Inside the <Identity> tag and make sure to indent each paragraph with four spaces. For example:
  <History>
      Fishing has always been a good way to gather food. Not only are fish high in important nutrients, but they are abundant in most large bodies of water.
  </History>

We're writing for en_US. It really doesn't matter what you use but a tool like LanguageTool will help greatly with spellchecking. See 0 A.D.'s style guide here: https://trac.wildfiregames.com/wiki/EnglishStyleGuide

Here are some more that we've decided on:

for consistency use BC and AD for the dates not BCE and CE

Keep numbers simple. You can write One to Nine out or ones like Million but everything else write as numerals I.E. 12345 Instead of Twelve-Thousand Three hundred and Forty Five
Likewise, all dates should be numerals. I.E. 100 AD
Finally, we can use decimals instead of fractions ie. 1.5 instead 1 and 1/2 likewise use 2 to 3 instead of 2-3
We use the US customary system for the measurements, and please do not abbreviate them.

As for content, some parts of history can be gruesome but try to keep the writing fairly clean no please no gruesome tortures, or sacrifice rites.
Also, History is some complicated so write in a clear, polite style that tries to see everything in context of the history and place.


Also put sources that you use for information in the sources folder in a file for the suspific unit group. I.E. we'll have one for sparta and another for Animals.'
Also when you add your sources. Add your 0 A.D. Handle at the end so we can contact you later if we have any questions.

RUNNING:
put the : 0-ad-history-mod-package in the subdirectory with the rest of your mods.
