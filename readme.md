History Mod:

0AD's initiative to give a historical and educational context to the game, the AoE saga also brings this feature, where AoM stands out the most.

It explains every detail, technology, building and unit.

The encyclopedia is included in the game. It gives a simple and short summary of the topics covered.

This is the updated version of the encyclopedia that used to be in the 0 A.D. revision: https://trac.wildfiregames.com/browser/ps/trunk/binaries/data/mods/public/simulation/templates/units?rev=19959&order=name However we need

CONTRIBUTING:

We'll discuss this mod on the forum here:  
https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/107400-0-ads-built-in-encyclopedia/#comment-552231

Use <History> </History> Inside the <Identity> tag and make sure to indent each paragraph with four spaces. For example:
  <History>
      Fishing has always been a good way to gather food. Not only are fish high in important nutrients, but they are abundant in most large bodies of water.
  s</History>

We're writing for en_US. It really doesn't matter what you use but a tool like LanguageTool will help greatly with spellchecking. See 0 A.D.'s style guide here: https://trac.wildfiregames.com/wiki/EnglishStyleGuide
  
for consistancy use B.C. and A.D. for the dates not BC and CE

Also put sources that you use for information in the sources folder in a file for the suspific unit group. I.E. we'll have one for sparta and another for Animals.

RUNNING:
put the : 0-ad-history-mod-package in the subdirectory with the rest of your mods.
