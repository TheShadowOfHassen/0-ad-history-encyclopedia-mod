        The Pentères, the Greek quinquereme, was a large and heavy warship commonly used during the Hellenistic age (4th to 1st century B.C.). Its oars were arranged in three stacked rows on each side, similar to a trireme, but with two rows of oarsmen working each of the top two levels and one single row of oarsmen working the lowest level. This brought the total up to 300 oarsmen distributed in five rows on each side, hence the name "Pentères" / "Quinquereme" (both meaning "five-rowed").
        Quinqueremes proved to be superior to triremes. Their greater size provided more resistance against harsh weather, allowing them to stay at sea under stormy conditions that would force smaller vessels back to port. With more deck space, quinqueremes could garrison a larger number of marines as well as mount catapults on the deck while still maintaining high speed and maneuverability powered by their five rows of oarsmen.
        Most importantly, the quinquereme's thicker, sturdier hull enabled it to better withstand ramming by enemy vessels. Collisions that would sink a trireme often only inflicted minimal damage on a quinquereme. This shifted the focus of naval combat away from the ramming tactics dominant in earlier eras like the Peloponnesian War and more towards boarding and close-quarters fighting. The quinqueremes' resilience, troop capacity, and speed made it the most efficient war galley of its time.
