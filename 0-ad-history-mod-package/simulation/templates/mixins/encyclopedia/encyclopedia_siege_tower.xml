        Because siege towers were so bulky, they were often constructed on site from materials gathered from the surrounding area. Although they came in different sizes, they were always at least as tall as the besieged city`s walls.
        In 0 A.D.'s timeframe (500 BC to 500 AD), siege towers, against popular opinion, often only served as an elevated platform for archers to target defending soldiers on the wall. Siege towers were also frequently used on top of ships. Some siege towers, once they came close enough, dropped down a bridge, allowing heavy infantry from inside to storm directly onto the walls. Battering rams that were built into the tower's bottom layers could also damage or breach the walls. No doubt, if successfully deployed, siege towers would significantly help with taking the city; defenders tried to stop it with all means .
        Drawing or pushing the heavy siege tower forward on its wheels, for example, required relatively flat terrain. This was commonly exploited with the construction of moats around fortifications. And because of how heavy they were, defenders oftentimes also attempted to make the tower tip over or get stuck; for example, by digging tunnels, it would sink in.Another tactic was to set the siege tower, largely built of wood, on fire, with burning arrows, for example. To prevent this, the towers were often covered in sheets of inflammable or wet materials.
