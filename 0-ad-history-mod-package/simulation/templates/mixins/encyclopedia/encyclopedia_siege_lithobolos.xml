        The lithobolos (translated “stone-thrower”) was a type of Greek catapult, probably first constructed for Dionysius of Syracuse's expedition against Carthage. Its defining feature was a newly developed mechanism: the lithobolos got its power from the torsion of bundles of sinew, skein, or fiber instead of the tension of a bow like traditional weapons did. The twisting was done by the catapult's arms running through the bundle and rotating as the bowstring was pulled back. For the latter, a winch mechanism was used. 
        This, on the one hand, was slow, but on the other hand, it allowed for great draw weights and, subsequently, strong shooting power. Variants of the lithobolos came in all different sizes and shapes, depending on the need. Some even had a grooved stock and were specifically designed for the launch of arrows. 
        Catapults like the lithobolos had a huge impact on siege warfare, as they enabled attackers to breach a city's fortification while keeping a safe distance. This could bring victory and save the time and effort of a long siege.
