        The idea to build Athens' walls was probably first proposed by the politician Themistocles after Athens was completely destroyed during the Second Persian Invasion. While the walls around the city were constructed right away, the famous Long Walls would not be until 20 years later, around 460 BC.
        The two Long Walls were around 3.7 miles long  (6 kilometers) and, stood parallel, at around 6500 feet (200 meters) apart. The Long walls protected the passage to Athens' port, Piraeus. Another wall further to the east was also constructed, leading towards another smaller port called Phaleron. This wall formed a triangle enclosed by the walls and the shore, and the space between was used for agriculture. The entire Athenian wall system was over 15 miles long (25 kilometers), around 9 feet wide (3 meters), and 30 feet high (9 meters) and became a majestic symbol for Athens' power and dominance.
        The walls formed a key point in Athens's war strategy. They could avoid fighting enemies on land and instead rely on their powerful navy to engage in combat with them. And, in case of a siege, the city had coastal access in its walls, which meant all necessary food could be brought from the sea. 
        This strategy worked well, but only as long as Athenian ships were able to provide a constant inflow of food. For example, when the Athenian fleet was annihilated at Aegospotami (405 BC), the besieged city of Athens' was cut off from food supplies and had no choice but to surrender.
