        Battering rams are one of, if not the single, most popular siege engines of all time. They came in all different sizes and shapes and were generally very easy to construct. The earliest versions were just groups of soldiers carrying long poles, often tree logs, and ramming them against the targets.
        However, during classical antiquity, 0 A.D.'s time, battering rams had been developed further: The pole was usually hung from a frame by ropes or chains. For ramming, the pole was pulled back and released. The pole swung forward, and its head, often reinforced with iron or steel, hitting the target. Because all the heavy pole's force was concentrated at the tip, even small rams could break through strong gates or crack thick walls.
        The people operating the ram were protected from projectiles by a canopy, either carried by the soldiers themselves or rolling on wheels. Since it was normally made from wood, defenders often tried to set it on fire. To counter that, the construction was covered in nonflammable materials such as wet hides. Defenders also tried to immobilize or damage battering rams by dropping heavy rocks on them.
