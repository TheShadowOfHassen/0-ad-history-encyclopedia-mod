        Villages situated in resource rich areas naturally grew in both size and wealth. In accordance so did the interest of outside eyes. Soldiers could easily raid or even conquer an undefended village. So when most villages grew, defenses sprung up around them, if there was a good supply of wood, a palisade was a viable choice. While they werenâ€™t nearly as durable as stone walls, palisades could be built quicker and without the help of trained craftsmen.
