        Penteconters were around 800 B.C. and were the most widely used ships throughout Greece. As the Greek name "Pentēkóntoros" ("fifty-oared") suggests, they had 50 oars total, so 25 on each side. Penteconters averaged 12 feet in width and 100 feet in length, including the naval ram at the bow.
        At that time, there was no distinction between warships and merchant ships; crews consisted of soldiers who fought aboard to defend the ship. Large-scale naval battles were rare, so penteconters mostly served as troop transports and merchant vessels.
        Around the 7th century B.C., biremes and triremes (faster ships with more oars) came up, which replaced penteconters, which, due to the comparatively few oarsmen, were slower and less maneuverable. Penteconters still continued to be used in smaller numbers for trading since they required fewer rowers than the faster and larger ships.
