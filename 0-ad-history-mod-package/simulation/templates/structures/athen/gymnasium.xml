    <History>
        The gymnasium (derived from “gymnos”, a Greek term for nudity), was a facility for physical exercise. It consisted of a large field that functioned as an exercise area and was surrounded by changing and practicing rooms. Gymnasia were constructed all over Greece, some smaller, some larger, sometimes even with spectator stands like stadiums. Many young men (it was exclusive to male citizens) spent large portions of their day at the gymnasium practicing all kinds of sports like jumping, wrestling, boxing, javelin, and discus throwing. As the name suggests, in the gymnasium, it was customary for athletes to exercise completely naked. Contests in these various sports were also held, often on the occasion of religious rituals and festivals. The most famous one, of course, were the Olympic Games in Olympia.
        Because the Ancient Greeks believed in a strong connection between education and sports, the gymnasium, over time, also became a place of intellectual endeavor where lectures and speeches were given. Specific gymnasia were often associated with specific schools of philosophy.
