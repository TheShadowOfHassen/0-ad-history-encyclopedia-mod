    <History>
        Trade was vital for Athens' economy. The poor quality of the soil in Greece made it difficult for Athens to produce enough food for its population. To meet the high demand, the required grain was imported from Egypt and wood from Italy. Athenians traded at the agora, a large marketplace and civic center in the heart of the city. They bought staple foods, jewelry, slaves, and other commodities. In return, they sold local products such as olive oil, wine, grapes, honey, and silver. Athenian pottery was especially popular and widely sought after by customers from all throughout the known world, as it was renowned for its high artistic and functional qualities. The manufacture of this pottery was unique to the Greek, especially Athenian, culture.
