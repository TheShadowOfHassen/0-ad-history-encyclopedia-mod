    <History>
        Because cavalry in Ancient Greece played an insignificant role in most battles, Athenians, for a long time,  saw no need to create a competitive cavalry. Instead, they relied on allies to provide cavalrymen or hired mercenaries. However, in the 5th century BC, the Athenians finally recognized the value of home-grown cavalry, maybe after having themselves faced the skilled Persian horsemen in the Greco-Persian wars, and started recruiting.
        Each of the ten Athenian tribes was obligated to provide their own cavalry squadron, each under the command of their—in true democratic fashion—yearly elected leader called phylarch. The phylarchs themselves were commanded by the two—again, in true democratic fashion—yearly elected Athenian cavalry commanders called hipparchs.
        Back then, the biggest struggle of raising cavalry lied in financing. Soldiers had to purchase their own equipment, and horses were very expensive, some costing multiple times  the yearly income of an average worker. That's why the Athenian state issued what we today would describe as establishment loans to financially facilitate entry into the cavalry corps. There also was a “horse insurance” system in place for those whose horses had died in battle.
        As a result of the effort and money the Athenian state had invested in expanding their cavalry, by the year 431 BC, the number of Athenian cavalrymen had grown to 1000 heavy cavalry and 200 mounted bowmen and was, at the time, one of the largest cavalry forces in Greece.
