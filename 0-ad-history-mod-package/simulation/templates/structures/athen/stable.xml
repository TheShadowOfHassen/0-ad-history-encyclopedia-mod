    <History>
        Because cavalry in Ancient Greece posed a comparably insignificant factor in most battles, for a long time, the Athenians saw no need and made no efforts in raising competitive cavalry themselves. If necessary, they instead relied on allies to provide cavalrymen or hired mercenaries. However, in the 5th century BC, the Athenians finally recognized the value of home-grown cavalry, maybe after having faced the menacing Persian horsemen in the Greco-Persian war themselves, and started recruiting.
        Each of the ten Athenian tribes was obligated to provide their own cavalry squadron, each under the command of their—in true democratic fashion—yearly elected leader called phylarch. The phylarchs themselves were commanded by the two—again, in true democratic fashion—yearly elected Athenian cavalry commanders called hipparchs.
        The biggest struggle of raising cavalry lied in financing. As was customary in Greece, Athenian soldiers had to purchase their own equipment, and horses were very expensive, some costing multiple times an average worker's yearly income. That's why the Athenian state issued what we today would describe as establishment loans to financially facilitate entry into the cavalry corps. There also was a “horse insurance” system in place for those whose horses had died in battle.
        As result of the effort and money the Athenian state had invested in expanding their cavalry, by the year 431 BC, the number of Athenian cavalrymen had grown to 1000 heavy cavalry and 200 mounted bowmen, one of the largest cavalry forces in Greece at the time.
