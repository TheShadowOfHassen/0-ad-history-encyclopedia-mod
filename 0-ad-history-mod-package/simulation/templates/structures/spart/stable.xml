    <History>
        Cavalry for a long time was a weak spot in Sparta’s military. For the longest time, their only force was the Hippeis, a force of 300 mounted infantry who would guard the kings and perform in religious ceremonies. Apart from this small force, for centuries, Sparta made hardly any efforts to recruit competitive cavalry of their own and rather bolstered their ranks with mercenaries or relied on allies to provide cavalrymen. This was for several reasons: Firstly, cavalry units in Ancient Greece posed a comparably insignificant factor in most battles anyway, and they generally avoided direct engagement with the enemy's line. Secondly, in Sparta, fighting on a horse was frowned upon; they considered cavalry service to be only for those who could not fight on foot. Additionally, because all Spartan soldiers had to provide their own equipment, most just couldn't afford to purchase and maintain a horse.
        But even with reinforcements from allies or mercenaries, the number of cavalry units in the Spartan army only ever amounted to 60 per mora (Xenophon wrote that a mora contained around 600 men).
