    <History>
        Most of Greece is mountainous and not well suited for farming. Some think only twenty percent of Greece was usable for farming. Less of this was farm fields because Greece also cultivated grape vineyards and olive orchards. What was fields was mostly sown with barley, although wheat was used as well.
        However, the Spartans people did not farm. It was the helots that did it for them.
