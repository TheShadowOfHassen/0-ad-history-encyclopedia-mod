    <History>
        The Lighthouse of Alexandria was located on a small island called Pharos, just off the coast of Alexandria. Construction was commissioned by Ptolemy I Soter, the founder of the Ptolemaic kingdom, and lasted multiple decades, costing 800 talents (equivalent to some tens of millions of modern-day US dollars) in total.
        The building itself had a 90-by-90-foot (30-meter) base and was divided into three parts. The bottom block was square-the middle block octagonal- and the top part circularly shaped. Including an alleged statue at the top, the lighthouse was said to measure over 300 feet (100 meters) in height, making it the second-tallest man-made structure at the timeâ€”only behind the pyramids of Giza.
        Not only in terms of size but also architecture and engineering, the lighthouse marked an impressive achievement, and it became a famed landmark for the metropolis of Alexandria. It is not without reason counted towards the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
        And the structure proved very resilient: The Lighthouse of Alexandria survived over 1600 years before, damaged by multiple earthquakes, collapsing, or being taken down.
