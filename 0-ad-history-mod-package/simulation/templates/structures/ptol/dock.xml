    <History>
        The Ptolemies constructed huge numbers of ships. At their peak, according to today's estimations, they possessed up to 1000 warships in total, distributed to four fleets, one at the Nile, one in the Red Sea, one in the Aegean Sea and one at Alexandria.
        But not only were the Ptolemaic ships large in numbers, but also large in size. The Ptolemies were known to build massive ships. They frequently used octeres, ships with almost double as many rowers as the quinquereme which was the usual ship at that time. Ptolemy IV even constructed the Tesseraconteres, the largest manpowered galley in human history, carrying 7000 people. However, because of its enormous size, this ship was never used in combat.
        After major defeats in battles around 250 BC Ptolemaic naval hegemony in the Mediterranean declined. But even weakened, the sea empire existed for another 200 years until the defeat at the battle of Actium in 31 BC, marking the end of the Ptolemaic Kingdom.
