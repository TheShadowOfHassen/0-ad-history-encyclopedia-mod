    <History>
        While the Greek upper class worshiped the Greek deities, or whatever other deities that they discovered their fancy, the Egyptian people were more conservative. The Egyptians kept worshiping the same gods they had been.
        This created an interesting power dichotomy in the Ptolemaic empire that wasnâ€™t in other Hellenistic kingdoms. Unlike in other places, where the king's word was law, the Ptolemaic kings had to be careful to respect the Egyptian priests and their temples, in fear of the people rising up.
