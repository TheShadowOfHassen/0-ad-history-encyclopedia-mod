    <History>
        Houses in the Ptolemaic empire were a varied lot. In cities, you were just as often to find apartment complexes as individual houses. However, both did exist.
        Ptolemaic houses were inspired by both the Hellenistic and Egyptian cultures. Many had two stories and a small courtyard, however, they were constructed with clay bricks in the way of the Egyptians.
