    <History>
        The Ptolemaic dynasty of Ancient Egypt was known for its extensive overland trading network, which connected the Mediterranean to  both the east and the south. This trade network had been in place for centuries before the Ptolemies, but the Greek immigrants who settled in Egypt had a profound impact on the nature of trade in the southeast part of the known world. By securing strategic locations, such as cities and ports, along important traveling routes, either by forming alliances or by conquering, they maximized their access to goods  and resources that flowed through the Ptolemaic trading network.
        Ptolemaic merchants extensively traded in Africa, India and other parts of Asia, exporting agricultural products such as grain, wine and olive oil, textiles and spices in exchange for metals and exotic luxury items.
