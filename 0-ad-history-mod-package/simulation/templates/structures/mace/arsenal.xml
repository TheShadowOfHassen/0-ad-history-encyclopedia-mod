    <History>
        Philip II saw great potential in siege engines and had engineers develop weapons like battering rams and catapults for his army. His engineers built many kinds of siege engines. These new advanced engines completely revolutionized siege warfare and provided the Macedonian army with a huge advantage over any enemy.  Later, Alexander the Great (Philip II's successor) developed the Macedonian siege weapons further and made use of many different kinds of siege engines when conquering of Persia.
