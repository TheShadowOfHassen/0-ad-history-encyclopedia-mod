    <History>
        The Persian Empire was home to many prosperous cities that amassed enormous wealth. Alexander the Great conquered these cities one by one and eventually reached and captured Persepolis, the Persian capital city, and the royal treasury. He got into possession of a huge amount of gold coinage that had belonged to the Persians. Some estimate the value of this treasure at up to 1.6 trillion modern US dollars. Others estimate it to be “just” several hundred billions. Either way, this was a staggering sum of money. However, unlike many other world leaders in the ancient world, Alexander was not interested in hoarding wealth or living in luxury. He instead generously distributed the money among the Greeks. This infusion of money stimulated the economy and created a period of unprecedented prosperity in the Hellenistic and Persian worlds. Many people became extremely rich and enjoyed a high standard of living. The effects of Alexander’s lavish spending lasted longer than his own life and empire. The gold he brought into circulation and the prosperity that came with it were used to fund military campaigns. The following decades and centuries were filled with conflicts and wars, unintentionally “sponsored” by Alexander's big spending.
