    <History>
       In contrast to many Greek city-states, Macedon was governed by a monarchy. The king, holding the title of “Basileus”, was the head of both making laws, and inforcing them. He also represented the kingdom in foreign affairs and, of course, held supreme command over the military; commonly leading them into batle personally.
        The king was supported by a cabinet of personally appointed companions. In its essence, it functioned as what we today would call a court. Most kings gathered various other advisors and bodyguards around themselves as well, often comprised of members of noble families. There was also an assembly of citizen soldiers who could elect or depose a king. It is uncertain, though, how much power these groups actually held.
