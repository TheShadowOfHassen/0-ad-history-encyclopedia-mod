    <History>
        	The Macedonians still worshiped and sacrificed to the old Greek gods. However after the conquests of Alexander the Great, the pantheon to worship was significantly expanded. Immigrants and traders brought brought their religions all across the empire. A single city could house places of worship for not only Zeus and Athena, but gods from Egypt, Persia, and even Yahweh, the God of Israel.
