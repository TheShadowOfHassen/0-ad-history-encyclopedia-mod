    <History>
        The Seleucid dynasty claimed to be descendant from Apollo. They claimed that Apollo visited the mother of the first ruler Seleucus I and spent the night with her, leaving as proof a ring engraved with an anchor. When he was born, Seleucus I had a matching birthmark on his thigh. The Seleucid dynasty claimed the heirs as well bore the mark.
        Seleucus I built the temple of Pythian Apollo, dedicated to his alleged father in Daphne.
