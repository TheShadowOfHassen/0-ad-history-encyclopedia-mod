    <History>
        The Míngtáng Bìyōng, or “Bright Hall” was a temple built in the Imperial Palace in the Han capitol of Chang’and. The building was constructed directly south of the Han dynasty’s founder, Emperor Gaozu, and was symmetrical not only north-south, like most Han buildings, but east-west as well. The Míngtáng Bìyōng was a sight of many religious practices, including ones performed by the emperor himself.
