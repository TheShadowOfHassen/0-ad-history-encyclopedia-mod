    <History>
        The Han Empire's vast lands was a place of cultural diversity, and home to many beliefs and religions. The most widespread ones were Taoism and Buddhism. However, the central imperial government followed a legalistic and confucianistic ideology. Legalism claims the necessity of law, justice, and control, while Confucianism is all about morality, reigning gently and obeying.
        The Han political system was complex but clearly structured. There was a very strict hierarchy, and great respect was demanded for higher-ranking people. Han emperors were, unlike many other emperors in history, not worshipped as gods but seen as Mandates of Heaven, representing the gods on earth.
        But not only the official administration held a strong hierarchy; following the Confucian model, the man would lead a family, women and kids had little freedom, were clearly subordinate to the man, and had to obey him.
        The highest goal of this system, based on Confucian teachings, was to establish order, harmony was believed to be the foundation for an ideal society.
        And it worked. At least for a certain time. Especially the early days of the Han Empire were times of peace (at least within the Empire's borders) and flourishing of Chinese culture. This time was certainly not without reason called “The Golden Age of China”.
