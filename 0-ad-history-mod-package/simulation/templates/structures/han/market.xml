    <History>
        In the first century BC, after the Han had defeated the Xiognu (a nomadic people inhabiting the lands north of the Han Empire), they were able to secure the Hexi Corridor, a long, narrow passage leading through an otherwise ungracious and hostile terrain. Through the Hexi Corridor, the Han now had a safe connection to the West and established trade routes leading into the wide and unknown world. This trade network, over a staggering 6400 kilometers (4000 miles) long, is today called the Silk Road. It led from the Han Empire through Middle Asia to present-day India and all the way to Europe, where there was another powerful empire centered around the Mediterranean, one that, in size, even rivaled the Han Empire. Yes, I am talking about the Roman Empire.
        Of course there is a reason it is called the Silk Road, for although merchants brought many products such as foods, livestock, and jewelry, one product was especially sought after, silk. Silk was exclusively produced in China and so was worth many times its  weight in gold, was brought into all corners of the world.
        But not only goods were exchanged; traders transmitted their beliefs, customs, and knowledge to the people they encountered. The Silk Road is the first example of globalization in human history.
