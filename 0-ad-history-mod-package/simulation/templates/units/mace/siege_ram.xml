    <History>
        The Krios (battering ram) was one of the most popular siege weapons in Ancient Greece, and was used to damage walls or make them collapse.
        A 65- to 150-foot-long pole was hung by ropes on a horizontal beam. It was pulled back and released. The pole swung forward, hitting the wall at maximum speed. The people operating the ram were protected by a roofed shell. The whole construction rolled on wheels because it was too heavy to be carried.
        Defenders tried to stop battering rams by throwing heavy rocks at them or trying to set them on fire.
        There are several recorded occasions of the Macedonians using all different kinds of siege weapons. For example, Philip II used battering rams when capturing the city Amphipolis in 357 BC.
