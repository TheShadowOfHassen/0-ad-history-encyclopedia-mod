    <History>
        Engineers in Ancient Greece, trying to improve the traditional bow, developed the gastraphetes, a crossbow. However, they wanted an even more powerful weapon, and in the 4th century B.C., the oxybeles was invented.
        Philip II of Macedon saw great potential in siege engines and had engineers develop weapons like battering rams and catapults for his army. His engineers built many kinds of siege engines. These new advanced engines completely revolutionized siege warfare and provided the Macedonian army with a huge advantage over any enemy.  Later, Alexander the Great (Philip II's successor) developed the Macedonian siege weapons further and used them in his conquest of Persia. Even though the oxybeles (bolt shooter) was not developed in Macedon, Philip II used them in many battles, for example in the siege of Olynthus.
        The oxybeles was just a very big gastraphetes (crossbow). It was mounted on a triapod with a swivel joint and fired big arrows or javelins. Just like the gastraphetes, the oxybeles was made from horn, wood, and sinew. Even though it had greater power, range, and accuracy than most weapons at that time, it was not strong enough to take down buildings or walls. But still, the oxybeles was a very dangerous weapon, and it could pierce any soldier's shield and armor from hundreds of feet away.
