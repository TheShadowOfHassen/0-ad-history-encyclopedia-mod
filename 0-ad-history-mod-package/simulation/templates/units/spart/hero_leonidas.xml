    <History>
        Leonidas I was king of Sparta in the 5th century BC. In 480 BC, when Persian King Xerxes I invaded Greece with a massive army, Leonidas led a much smaller army consisting of 300 Spartans, his elite royal bodyguard called “Hippeis”, and other Greeks support troops, in total around 7000 men, to the narrow pass of Thermopylae and blocked the Persians advance.
        They were heavily outnumbered, facing 300,000 Persians in a suicidal battle in hopes of delaying the Persians long enough for the allied Greeks to evacuate Attica and prepare for battle. The Persians eventually found a path around the pass and surrounded the Greeks, Leonidas told most of his troops to retreat, while he and about 1,000 other soldiers stayed behind to fight until death.
        In total, they were able to stop the Persians for an entire week, and killed thousands of their soldiers, including two of Xerxes' own brothers. Leonidas and his soldiers became a symbol for bravery, loyalty and sacrifice. His corpse was returned to Sparta, where he was buried with honor. A monument stone was placed at the Spartan's burial mound at Thermopylae. On it was engraved the famous epitaph: “Go tell the Spartans, thou who passest by, that here, obedient to her laws, we lie.”
