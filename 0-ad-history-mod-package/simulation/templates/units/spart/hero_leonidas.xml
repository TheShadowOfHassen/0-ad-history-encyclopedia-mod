    <History>
        Leonidas I was king of Sparta in the 5th century BC. In 480 BC, when Persian King Xerxes I invaded Greece with a massive army, Leonidas led a much smaller army consisting of 300 Spartans, his elite royal bodyguard called “Hippeis”, and other Greeks support troops, in total around 7000 men, to the narrow pass of Thermopylae and blocked the Persians advance.
        They were heavily outnumbered. They faced 300,000 Persians in a suicidal battle. Delaying the Persians long enough for the allied Greeks  to evacuate Attica and prepare for battle. The Persians eventually found a path around the pass and surrounded the Greeks, Leonidas told most of his troops to retreat, while he and about 1,000 other soldiers stayed behind to fight until death.
        In total they delayed the Persians by an entire week, killing thousands of soldiers and even two of Xerxes' brothers. Leonidas became a symbol for bravery, loyalty and sacrifice. As the famous epitaph commemorating the fallen soldiers at Thermopylae composed by Greek poet Simonides of Ceos says: “Go tell the Spartans, thou who passest by, that here, obedient to her laws, we lie.”
