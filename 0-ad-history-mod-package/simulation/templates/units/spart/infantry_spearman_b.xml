    <History>
        The Perioikoi were second-tier citizens of Sparta. Unlike the Spartan citizens, Perioikoi were not professional soldiers but produced weapons, food, and other goods.
        In wartime, they fought for Sparta equipped as Hoplites, just like the Spartiates.
        Hoplites were equipped with a large round shield with the Greek letter Λ (lambda) for Lacedaemon written on it. Their main weapon was a long spear, but they also carried a short sword as a secondary weapon for close-range melee combat. Those who could afford it also wore different parts of body armor.
        The Perioikoi were not as well-trained as the Spartiates but played an important role in many battles for Sparta.
