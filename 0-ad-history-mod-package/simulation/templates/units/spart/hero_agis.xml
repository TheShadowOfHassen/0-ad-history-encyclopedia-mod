    <History>
        Agis III was the 21st Eurypontid king of Sparta, who ruled from 338 BC to 331 BC. He inherited a Sparta that had lost many territories and its influential position in Greece to its rivals. Agis resented the Macedonian domination over Greece under Philip II and his son Alexander the Great. He refused to join the League of Corinth, a coalition of Greek city-states allied with Macedon, and went so far as to attempt to ally with the Persians, in order to overthrow the Macedonians.
        In 331 BC, Agis III formed a coalition with Elis, and many Achaean and Arcadian towns. He declared war on Macedon in hopes of overwhelming them, as Alexander the Great himself was waging war against Persia, and Antipater, Alexander the Great's regent in Greece, was fighting in Thrace. After Agis won a decisive victory over a Macedonian army, he besieged Megalopolis, a city founded by the Thebans to counter Sparta. However, Antipater, had made peace with the Thracians, came to defend Megalopolis with a larger force. In the deciding battle, the Spartan army was outnumbered and outmatched and were defeated in a bloody fight. 
        Agis died a heroic death; severely wounded, he was carried away from the battlefield, but when he saw the pursuing enemies, he told his men to leave him behind and run for their lives. Though he was heavily injured, he managed to rise to his knees and fight off several enemies, sacrificing himself in to cover the retreat of his men.
