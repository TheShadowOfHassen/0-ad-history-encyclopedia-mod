    <History>
        Agis III was the 21st Eurypontid king of Sparta, who ruled from 338 BC to 331 BC. He inherited a Sparta that had lost many territories and its influential position in Greece to its rivals. Agis resented the Macedonian domination over Greece under Philip II and his son Alexander the Great. He refused to join the League of Corinth, a coalition of Greek city-states allied with Macedon, and went so far as to attempt to ally with the Persians, in order to overthrow the Macedonians.
        In 331 BC, the time seemed right.  Alexander the Great was waging war in Persia, Antipater, Alexander's regent in Greece was fighting in Thrace, and the Macedonians under General Zopyrion lost to the Scythians. Agis, and a coalition of other anti-Macedon Greek states, declared war. Agis defeated the Macedonian army and went on to besiege Megaopolis, a city founded by the Thebans to counter Sparta. But before they could conqure the city,  Antipater made peace with the Thracians and marched to Megalopolis with a large force. The Spartan army, outnumbered and outmatched, was routed. 
        Agis died a heroic death; severely wounded, he was carried away from the battlefield, but when he saw the pursuing enemies, he told his men to leave him behind and run for their lives. Though he was heavily injured, he managed to rise to his knees and fight off several enemies, sacrificing himself in to cover the retreat of his men.
