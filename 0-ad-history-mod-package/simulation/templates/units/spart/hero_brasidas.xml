    <History>
        Brasidas was a Spartan general who lived in the 5th century BC and played an important and deciding role in the Peloponnesian War against Athens.
        His most important achievement was the capture of Amphipolis, a strategically important city in Thrace that controlled access to resources of gold and timber. He took the city by surprise in 424 BC and conquered it before the Athenians could arrive with reinforcements.
        Athens, however, was not about to give up such an important city. Over the next few years Brasidas would defend the city from several Athenian attacks, until in 422 the Athenian general Cleon arrived with a large army. It was the Battle of Amphipolis. Brasidas and a small force charged from the city, catching the disorganized Athenians off guard. The Athenians were routed and fled to their ships. Brasidas pursued, but was mortally wounded in the fight. Cleon too was slain, by the Spartans. The Battle of Amphipolis ended with a Spartan victory and led to the Peace of Nicias between Sparta and Athens.
        Brasidas was named as a hero, and was buried with honors in Amphipolis. Many Greeks regarded him as a liberator from Athenian domination. And he was one of the rare generals who earned respect and high reputation from both allies and enemies.
