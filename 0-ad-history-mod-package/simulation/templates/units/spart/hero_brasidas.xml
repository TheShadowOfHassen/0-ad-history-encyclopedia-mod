    <History>
        Brasidas was a Spartan general who lived in the 5th century BC and played an important and deciding role in the Peloponnesian War against Athens.
        His most important achievement was the capture of Amphipolis, a strategically important city in Thrace that controlled the access to gold and timber resources. He took the city by surprise in 424 BC, before the Athenians could arrive to defend.
        Brasidas defended Amphipolis against several Athenian attempts to recapture it. In 422 BC, when the Athenian general Cleon arrived with a large army to besiege Amphipolis, Brasidas led a sally from the city with a small force and caught Cleon and the disorganised Athenians who were waiting for reinforcements off guard. He routed the Athenians and pursued them to their ships, but was mortally wounded. Cleon was also killed in the battle by another Spartan commander. The Battle of Amphipolis ended with a Spartan victory and led to the Peace of Nicias between Sparta and Athens.
        Brasidas died as a hero, and was buried with honors in Amphipolis. Many Greeks regarded him as a liberator from the Athenian domination. He was one of the rare generals who earned respect and high reputation from both allies and enemies.
