    <History>
    Brasidas was a Spartan general who lived in the 5th century B.C. and played an important and deciding role in the Peloponnesian War against Athens.
His most important achievement was the capture of Amphipolis, a strategic city on the Strymon river that controlled the access to gold and timber resources. He took it by surprise in 424 B.C., before the Athenians could arrive with reinforcement.
Brasidas defended Amphipolis against several Athenian attempts to recapture it. He also gained the support of many other cities in the region, such as Acanthus, Stagirus and Toroni. Many Greeks regarded him as a liberator from the Athenian domination.
In 422 B.C., when the Athenian general Cleon arrived with a large army to besiege Amphipolis, Brasidas led a sally from the city with a small force and caught Cleon and the disorganised Athenians who were waiting for reinforcements off guard. He routed the Athenians and pursued them to their ships, but was mortally wounded. Cleon was also killed in the battle by another Spartan commander. The Battle of Amphipolis ended with a Spartan victory and led to the Peace of Nicias between Sparta and Athens.
Brasidas died as a hero and was buried with honors in Amphipolis. He was one of the few Spartans who earned respect and high reputation from both allies and enemies.
