    <History>
        In 235 BC, Cleomenes III became King of Sparta and reformed the Spartan military in hopes of bringing Sparta back to its former power and glory. He reintroduced the traditional military training system and gave Spartan citizenship to many Perioikoi, bringing the previously declining number of Spartan citizen soldiers (Spartiates) up to 4000.
        These soldiers (Phalangites Spartiates) carried a Macedonian pike instead of the traditional Hoplite spear, and they used the Macedonian Syntagma formation rather than the traditional Greek Phalanx.
        They fought in the Cleomenean War against the Archeaen League for Sparta. After winning several battles, Sparta was eventually defeated by Macedon.
