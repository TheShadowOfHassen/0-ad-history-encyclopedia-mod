    <History>
        Even in a boat, Sparta's large, iron currency was nearly impossible to transport. It was so worthless that a Spartan needed an entire room to purchase anything expensive. This was, however, intentional. Lycurgus established such a worthless currency so that the Spartans would forgo luxury and focus only on military strength.
