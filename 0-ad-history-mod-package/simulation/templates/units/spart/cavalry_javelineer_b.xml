    <History>
        The Spartans specialized in melee infantry combat. The soldiers had to buy their own equipment, and most could not afford horses. Because of that, the Spartans hardly used any cavalry in battles for centuries. Most horsemen in the Spartan army were either allies or mercenaries. 
        Sparta did recruit a few light-ranged cavalry units carrying javelins themselves, from the middle-class of Spartan society. Though, little to nothing is known about these units, it is assumed that they were armed the same way as skirmisher cavalrymen in other city-states were; with javelins for ranged attacks, as well as swords for close range combat. Some wore helmets and also had leather or linen armor. The horses had no horseshoes, bridles, stirrup or saddle, just a piece of cloth draped over their backs. 
        However, compared to other cavalry units in Greece, they were neither well-trained nor well-equipped. Without allied or mercenary units, cavalry always was a very weak part of the Spartan army.
