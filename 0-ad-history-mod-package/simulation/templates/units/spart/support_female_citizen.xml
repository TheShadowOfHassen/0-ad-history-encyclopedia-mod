    <History>
        Spartan women were some of the freest in the ancient world. Since the men were living in the barracks, the women managed their husband's lands and could own their own property.
        While it was not as rigorous as the men the girls were put through physical training so that they could give birth to healthy men. Unlike other Greeks and the Romans Spartan women not marry until they were adults, so that they could healthily give birth to children.
        Not only known for their physical prowess, Spartan women were known for their wisdom and audacity. A spartan princess, Gorgo, when Aristagoras tried to bribe her father told father to leave the room before Aristagoras corrupted him. And, of course, there is the famous saying that the Spartan women said to their husbands when they left for war, "Come back with your shields or on them."
