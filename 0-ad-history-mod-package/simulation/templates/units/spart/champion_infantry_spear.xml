    <History>
        All full-citizen males in Sparta (called Spartiates) underwent the harsh Spartan education and training system, the Agoge, which taught them physical resilience and prepared them for times of war. They received intense military training and remained full-time soldiers on duty until the age of 60. Spartiates trained and fought as hoplites.
        Hoplites were the most common type of soldier during the Archaic and Classical periods (8th to 4th century). They were equipped with a round convex shield, about 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter, which was reinforced with copper on the outside. It had the Greek letter Λ (lambda) for Lacedaemon written on it. Their main weapon was a 7 to 9-foot (around 2.5 meters)-long spear, which had an iron spearhead on one end and a spike on the other end as a counterweight. They also carried a short sword as a secondary weapon. Besides perhaps a bronze helmet, a hoplite's body armor varied between individuals, depending on what they could afford. Some wore bronze breastplates and greaves, others only leather or linen armor. In total, a hoplite's equipment weighed up to 70 pounds (about 30 kilograms).
        Spartiates were, in comparison to other hoplite forces in Ancient Greece, quite small in numbers and only formed the very core of every Spartan army. However, because they were so well trained and equipped, Spartiates had the reputation of being the best and deadliest soldiers in the ancient Greek world and were the reason Sparta stayed a dominant military force on mainland Greece, in spite of their small numbers.
