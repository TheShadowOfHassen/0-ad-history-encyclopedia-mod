    <History>
        The Prodromoi were a light cavalry unit in the Athenian military, established in the early fourth century BC, maybe as part of Iphicrates' military reforms. They were recruited from the lowest social class of Athenian citizens who didn't have the financial means to buy their own equipment. Instead, their equipment was provided by their phlyarchs, the expected commanders of each cavalry division.
        The Prodromoi were armed with javelins for ranged attacks, as well as swords for close-range combat. They wore bronze helmets, and some also had leather or linen armor. Horses had no horseshoes, bridles, stirrups, or saddles—just a piece of cloth draped over their backs. Scarce evidence suggests the total number of Prodromoi is estimated to be 200, only making up a small part of the Athenian cavalry.
        As the name "Prodromoi" ("pre-cursors", "runners-before", "runners-ahead") implies, they functioned as fast scouting units advancing ahead of the main army, gathering information about the enemy and the terrain. They also carried out skirmishes, harassing the enemy with their javelins.
        It is assumed that the Prodromoi corps was abolished in the third century BC, as the term "Podromoi" was used to referring to aides of cavalry officers.
