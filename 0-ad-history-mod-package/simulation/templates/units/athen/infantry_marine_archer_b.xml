    <History>
        The Cretans were renowned for their great archery skills and thought to be one of the best light infantry in the entire world. Many served as mercenaries for various Greek city-states such as Athens and Sparta, often on board ships where skilled archers were especially sought after. Even in Alexander the Great's armies were Cretan archers present and played a decisive role in some battles. After Alexander’s death, they continued to stand in the ranks for various Hellenistic rulers. The Romans also recognized their value and recruited Cretan archers into their armies. More than a thousand years later, in 1453, mercenary Cretan archers were still standing in the ranks of the Eastern Roman Empire, defending the city of Constantinople against the Ottoman army under Mehmet II.
        Greek archers generally fought with little to no protection to increase their mobility and speed in skirmishes. However, Cretan archers carried a small round shield as well as a sword, which made them, unlike many other skirmishing units, capable of defending themselves in close combat.
