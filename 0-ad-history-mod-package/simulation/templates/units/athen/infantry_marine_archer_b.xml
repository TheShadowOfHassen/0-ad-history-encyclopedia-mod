    <History>
        The Cretans were renowned for their great archery skills and thought to be one of the best light infantry units in the entire world. Many served as mercenaries for Greek city states such as Athens and Sparta and even for Alexander the Great in his conquest of Persia, where they played a decisive role in some battles. After Alexander’s death, they continued to fight for various Hellenistic rulers who succeeded him. The Romans also recognized their value and recruited Cretan archers into their armies. More than a thousand years later, in 1453, mercenary Cretan archers were still standing in the ranks of the Eastern Roman Empire, defending the city of Constantinople against the Ottoman army under Mehmet II.
        Cretan archers used composite bows, a type of bow reinforced with horn on the back side and sinew on the front. This enabled the bow to store more energy when drawn than a traditional bow of the same size would, giving Cretans a greater range and an edge over traditional archers.
        Although some sources report them wearing leather armor and helmets, Greek archers generally fought with little to no protection to increase their mobility and speed in skirmishes. However, Cretan archers carried a small round shield as well as a sword, which made them, unlike many other skirmishing units, capable of defending themselves in close combat.
