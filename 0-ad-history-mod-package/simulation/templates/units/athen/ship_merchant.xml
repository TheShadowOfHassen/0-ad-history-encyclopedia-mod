    <History>
        The Greek Inland was largely characterized by rugged and mountainous terrain, not suited for building roads or traveling. Because of that, for the Athenians, seaborne trade was always the easier and more efficient option when trading. Although the city of Athens itself was situated inland, about 5 miles from the sea, it controlled a large territory that included a long coastline and many islands. 
        Athens engaged extensively in trade along the vast routes that connected the coasts of the Mediterranean and Aegean seas, as well as the shores of Asia Minor and the Black Sea. These routes linked the Greek city-states on the mainland and the Greek colonies in Asia Minor. The city-state, especially Athens' port city, Piraeus, gained much wealth and luxury through this naval trading activity.
