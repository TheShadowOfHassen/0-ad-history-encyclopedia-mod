  <History>
      Throughout Ancient Greece, soldiers had to provide their own equipment. In wartime, people of the lowest social class in Athens who couldn't afford a hoplite's expensive equipment served either as oarsmen in the Athenian navy or as light infantry troops on land. These units were called “Psiloi” (skirmishers) and were armed with different kinds of missile weapons, such as slings, bows, or javelins. It's said some would even just carry stones and throw them at the enemies. Their lack of body armor and shield left them vulnerable in close combat, but also gave them an edge over the heavier-equipped but slower hoplites by enabling to outrun and outmaneuver them.
      However, for a long time, Athens hired mercenaries instead of recruiting capable ranged infantry units themselves; most Athenian “Psiloi” were just militia and therefore lacked training and experience. Compared to hoplites, they only had little effect on the outcome of most battles, as they weren't part of the main phalanx formation. Instead, they carried out skirmishes, tried to disrupt the enemy's formation, guarded the army camp, scouted the terrain, and pursued fleeing enemies.
