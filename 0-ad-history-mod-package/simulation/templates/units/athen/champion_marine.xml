    <History>
        Besides ramming, boarding and taking over the enemy's ship was a common tactic in naval warfare. Consequently, each Athenian warship was garrisoned by a number of marines, depending on the circumstances. In addition to the 170 oarsmen on each trireme, around 15 to 30 marine soldiers were part of the ship's crew. It is estimated that around 2 out of 3 of those were naval hoplites (called “Epibatai”); the rest were archers; mostly mercenaries.
        The “Epibatai” on the other hand, were Athenians. It seems like many of them were recruited from the fourth (and lowest) class of Athenian citizens and a good few also from the third social class (otherwise the primary pool for drafting hoplites into the land armies).
        As mentioned above, the “Epibatai” also fought as hoplites, carrying a large round shield, a 2-meter-long spear, and a sword as a secondary weapon. Compared to those fighting on land, they were probably armored lighter to suit the need of moving between ships and swimming should they fall overboard.
