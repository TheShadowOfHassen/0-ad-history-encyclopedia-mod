    Pericles was an Athenian politician, one of the, if not the single, most influential politician of his time. He governed Athens for multiple decades during its Golden Age, in the mid-5th century BC (between the Persian and Peloponnesian Wars), which is why this period is also often called the “Age of Pericles”. 
    Pericles promoted art, literature, and philosophy and followed a radical pro-democracy and liberal policy. He had many temples built on the Acropolis, including the famed Parthenon. Pericles essentially formed Athens into what it's famously known for: a center of thinking, learning, art, and democracy.
    Under his rule, Athens' also gained more and more power over its Greek allies and other Greek city-states; the Delian League (an alliance of Greek city-states against Persia) turned into an Athenian empire. However, this was what would ultimately lead to the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War against Sparta. Pericles himself died shortly into the war of the Plague of Athens, which might have been one of the reasons why Athens was eventually defeated by Sparta.
