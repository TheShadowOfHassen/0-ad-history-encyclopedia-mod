    <History>
        Iphicrates was an Athenian general in the 4th century BC. He had the reputation of being one of the most skilled commanders of his time. Among his many vicrories was the defea of Sparta in the Corinthian War. However, he is credited with the more famous feat of reforming the Athenian military, primarily by developing a new type of light infantry. 
        Compared to traditional hoplites, these new Iphicratean soldiers carried a longer spear and sword, and in place of the large, round shield, they had a smaller, lighter one, Finally they wore linen instead of heavier bronze armor. Iphicrates, being the son of a shoemaker, even designed a new type of footwear called “Iphicratids”, that was easier to tie and untie.  Iphicrates also made many other reforms, but as Diodoros says, “It would be tedious to write about them.”(Diod. 15.44)```
        While it is still a debated topic, soldiers in Iphicratean gear were likely to have fought as hoplites, meaning mainly as melee units. However, because these Iphicratean hoplites were equipped more lightly than traditional hoplites, they were faster, more agile, and often able to outmaneuver the latter. They also proved to be useful as marines in the Athenian fleet, because while fighting on ships, agility and range are more crucial than maximum body protection.```
