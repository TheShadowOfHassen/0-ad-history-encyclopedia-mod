    <History>
        Following the trend of building larger and heavier ships during the Hellenistic age (4th to 1st century B.C.), the Ptolemies constructed octeres ("eight-rowed"). These ships, averaging 20 feet in width and 100 feet in length, were powered by, as the name suggests, eight banks of oarsmen on three rows of oars on each side.
        The thick hull could withstand ramming by smaller ships, and the closed deck was large enough for catapults to be placed on it. Because of its massive size and weight, with its powerful and devastating ramming force, it was likely able to sink ships of any size and maybe even damage harbor structures, all while deploying hundreds of marines for boarding; octeres were the heaviest commonly used warship in antiquity.
        Despite the octeres' intimidating size and destruction power, it proved to be too bulky and impractical and was, due to its lack of maneuverability, very vulnerable against smaller, more agile ships. In the Battle of Actium in 31 B.C. (fought between the Romans and the Ptolemies), the Ptolemaic octeres were outmatched and beaten by the smaller Roman ships. This defeat sealed the downfall of Ptolemaic Egypt and its gigantic war galleys like the octeres.
