    <History>
       War horses were vital in the Han military's fight against the nomadic horsemen of the North. However, indigenous Chinese breeds were comparably small and too weak for use in battle. This forced the Han to resort to other means of obtaining horses for their cavalry.
        One possibility was through trading with various nomadic peoples. The empire's relation with the Xiognu was generally hostile, but sometimes the Han could trade with them for livestock. The Wusun, on the other hand, were close allies with the Han, and when forming the marriage alliance, the dowry even included 1,000 horses. If the Han couldn't trade for them, they took desired horses by force. The general Li Guangli famously conducted two very costly and dangerous exhibitions against the faraway Greco-Bactria to get hands on powerful horses — The War of the Heavenly Horses.
        And to ensure sufficient mounts in the long term, the Han government carried out large-scale horse-breeding programs. So large-scale, in fact, that the number of available horses rose to multiple hundreds of thousands. They built many designated horse breeding stations, especially in the North and also in the West, the most precarious regions of the empire. And the horses were under the care of professional horsekeepers.
