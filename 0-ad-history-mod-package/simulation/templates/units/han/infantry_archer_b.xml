    <History>
       Archery was always a central aspect of ancient Chinese culture. It was, after all, one of the Six Arts, an age-old curriculum created in the second millennium BC. 
        In the Han dynasty, however, because bow and arrow were rivaled by crossbows, they saw comparably low usage on the battlefield. At least among infantry units. For a long time, archers had been placed on chariots, but the Han also started employing mounted bowmen to counter the powerful Xiognu cavalry.
        Even if bow and arrow weren't used often in combat, they were still popular. The Ancient Chinese used the bow used for hunting, rituals, and also sport. And it wasn't just the commoners. The famous Chinese philosophers Confucius and Lie Zi were both avid archers.
