    <History>
        The Tiger and Leopard Cavalry was an elite cavalry division belonging to the warlord Cao Cao, commanded by his cousin Cao Chu. At that time, during the late Han dynasty and the early Three Kingdoms era (the first and second centuries BC), the use of cavalry was generally declining and shifting more towards heavier armor. There were other, similar cavalry divisions to the Tiger and Leopard cavalry in the armies of other warlords as well.
        Admission into this special force had high requirements; applicants, for example, had to command at least a hundred units to be eligible. Because of that, both the commander, Cao Chun, and the squadron itself were renown for their extreme discipline and physical capabilities. And could travel great distances in a comparably short amount of time.
        The Tiger and Leopard Cavalry were outfitted with the best equiptment. They fought with typical Chinese spears with leaf-shaped blades. They also carried a shield, and both the horses and riders were heavily armored.
        Despite this, one of the Tiger and Leopard Cavalry's strengths was their high flexibility in battle. They fought as shock troops and, at the desired moment and place on the battlefield, charged the enemy, trying to break up or disorganize their formation.
        All this made the Tiger and Leopard Cavalry the most lethal division in Cao Cao's army. Although they were small in numbers—a few thousand men at most—they could and did perform battle-deciding maneuvers.
