    <History>
        During the early Han period cavalry was more important than anytime else in Chinese history. The Xiognu, a nomadic horse people, posed a constant threat and were frequently raiding the dynasty's northern regions. And for the Han, the only way to defend their borders was (besides building a wall, of course) their own cavalry force. 
        Han cavalrymen were equipped with either a bow, sword, halberd, or lance. Horses and riders wore plate armor of iron, bronze, leather or cloth. While this was, in comparison to nomads, heavy protection, Han cavalry units remained highly mobile.
        A variety of tactics were applied by Han cavalry force, many of which they adopted from the Xiognu. The most prevalent were typical melee cavalry charges. But ambushes and hit-and-run weren't uncommon either, also less conventional tactics like feigning retreats. Cavalry was often supported by infantry and chariots or was used as an additional support force itself. 
        Because large parts of Han armies consisted of militia, and fighting on a horse required high skill, cavalry was considered an elite unit. At least in comparison to infantry. For that reason, many cavalrymen came from influential clans and families. However, the Han also hired auxiliaries from different nomadic tribes who were, thanks to their life style, very skilled on horseback. Although they were regarded as barbarians, their service was highly valued. Two of the most noteworthy were the Wusun and Wuhuan.
