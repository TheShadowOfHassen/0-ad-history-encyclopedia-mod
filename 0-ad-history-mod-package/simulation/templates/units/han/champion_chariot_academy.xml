    <History>
        The use of chariots in ancient China peaked between the 8th and 5th centuries BC. They were usually drawn by two or four horses and carried three men: the charioteer who steered the chariot, an archer typically standing to the charioteer's left, and a soldier carrying a dagger-axe to his right. The dagger-axe "ge" consisted of a dagger-like blade perpendicular to a long shaft. This made it ideal for swinging and pecking attacks and, therefore, perfect for chariot warfare. Due to its high length, the dagger axe could even reach enemy chariots. The chariot's crew wore various types of armor, like leather, and the horses too.
        Chariots were deployed for both attack, defense, and pursuit; there were different sizes and models for different needs. Because chariots were very vulnerable when being encircled, they were also generally accompanied by infantry. In attack, they fought as shock units, charging at the enemy line at their full speed of around 13 mph (20 km/h). Formations oftentimes could not withstand the impact and got scattered and disorganized, which ultimately decided the outcome of the battle. In fact, for some time, a state's military power was mostly determined by the number of chariots it could deploy.
        However, the chariot's effectiveness was tied to flat terrain. A rugged battleground rendered chariots almost useless. They were also powerless against cavalrymen, who were not only much faster but also more flexible. Because of this, as the battle conditions changed over time, the chariot declined in importance. During the Han period, the presence of chariots on the battlefield had shrunk to neglectable.
