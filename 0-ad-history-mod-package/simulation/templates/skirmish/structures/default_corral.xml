    <History>
         In ancient times meat was eaten much less frequently than today. It was far better to keep a sheep, for her milk, or a hen for her eggs. Most often the lower class would eat the meat from temple sacrifices. What wasnâ€™t burnt on the altar was often cooked and shared between the priests and the people.
