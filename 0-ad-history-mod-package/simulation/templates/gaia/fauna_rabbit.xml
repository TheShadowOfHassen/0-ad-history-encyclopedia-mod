    <History>
        Hailing from the Iberian Peninsula, the European rabbits are very social creatures. They have a brown coat and can grow around a foot long, and weigh up to six pounds.
        European rabbits live together in colonies in a labyrinth of tunnels and rooms called a warren. Warrens often can get very large in a short amount of time. A female rabbit can have up to nine children in a litter and can have up to seven liters a year.
        Due to their fast breeding and the fact that they enjoy cultivated plants, rabbits were a pest in ancient times as much as they are today. Fortunately, their meat was good, and they were hunted, sometimes for sport.
