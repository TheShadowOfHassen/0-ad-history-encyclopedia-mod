    <History>
        Whales are not only the biggest creature in the water but also the biggest mammal and the biggest animal in the world. This whale is a baleen whale, which means it has no teeth. Instead, it uses plates in its mouth (also called baleen) to filter plankton and small fish out of the water and eat them.
        Because whales are mammals, they do not have gills like fish to breathe; they hold their breath underwater and have to come up for air every so often.
        This whale is a Humpback Whale. Humpback Whales are known for their eerie singing, which can be heard for miles.
