    <History>
        Despite their length, giraffe’s necks have only seven bones; the same number as every other mammal, theirs are just much larger. Thanks to that neck, the giraffe is the tallest animal in the world, reaching over sixteen feet tall. Aside from the neck the giraffe is very recognizable with its thin, tall legs, large feet and special fur covered horns called ossicones. The giraffe’s coat is also distinctive, but comes in many different patterns depending on the subspecies. Giraffes while mostly ranging in central Africa in modern times, in ancient times it spanned much further north.
