    <History>
        The one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) is a unique animal well suited for hot, dry climates. They can get enough water to live from the desert vegetation. They can handle large drops in water and can drink enough water to kill another animal of the same size. Camels store fat in a large hump on their back, and it helps them stay cool. Adult dromedaries can stand up to seven feet at their shoulders and weigh 1,500 pounds.
        The one humped camel is, of course, related to the two humped camel which has two fat humps on their back instead of one. Also, camels are related to Alpacas and Llamas.
