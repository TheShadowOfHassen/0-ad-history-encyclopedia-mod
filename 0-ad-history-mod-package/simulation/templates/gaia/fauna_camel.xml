    <History>
        The one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) is a unique animal well suited for hot, dry climates. They can get enough water to live from desert vegetation and can survive large drops in their body’s water content. When there is water, the one-humped camel can drink an amount that would kill another animal of similar size. Camels store fat in a large hump on their back, and it helps them stay cool. Adult dromedaries can stand up to seven feet at their shoulders and weigh 1,500 pounds (680.39 kilograms).
       The one-humped camel is, of course, related to the two-humped camel, which has two fat humps on its back instead of one. Camels are also related to Alpacas and Llamas.
