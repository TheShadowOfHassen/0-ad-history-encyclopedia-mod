    <History>
        While their size and color varied from location, wolves in the ancient world were one species, Canis Lupis. Wolves are canine predators who run in packs consisting of extended families. Together, they live, hunt and raise the next generation of wolves.
       In recent times, some people have begun to question if wolves are as aggressive as they are sometimes portrayed, but with that aside, the coordination in packs allows them to take down animals far bigger than themselves. And if the fancy struck them, they could easily kill a gatherer who was working by himself.
