    <History>
        Of the three species of elephant, the Asian Elephant is the smallest, growing only 11 feet (3.35 meters) tall. It is also considered the most intelligent of the three species, having been observed using simple tools. The Asian Elephant has been domesticated for thousands of years and used for not only pack animals but also for war.
        The Asian elephant has drastically smaller ears, and their tusks are much smaller, some females may not have them at all. They have a fingerlike growth called a process on their trunk that helps them use it to pick up items.
        Wild Asian elephants live in herds led by the eldest female, or matriarch.
        This elephant is an infant.
