    <History>
        The Brown Bear has the widest distribution of all the bears. It ranges from North America to Europe to Asia. Due to its widespread habitat, there are many subspecies of Urs Arctos, some of which look quite different.
	Brown bears have dense fur coats that can be not only be brown but also blond or black. Brown bears are best recognized by the large hump on their shoulders. They can grow up to 9 feet (2.74 meters) long and can weigh up to 550 pounds (249 kilograms). While it usually eats plants, a Brown Bear would not hesitate to eat meat, and of all the species of bear, the brown bear is probably the most qualified to take it due to its size and power. Brown Bears hibernate during the winter to avoid food shortages.
