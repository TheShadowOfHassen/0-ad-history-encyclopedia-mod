    <History>
        Cattle, or cows, as they are often called, were domesticated all over the world at the same time and were a pivotal creature in the building of any ancient civilization. They were useful not only for their meat and milk but also for their strength as beasts of burden, and several breeds were bred specifically for this purpose.
        This cattle is a bull, and like many other male animals, it can be very territorial.
