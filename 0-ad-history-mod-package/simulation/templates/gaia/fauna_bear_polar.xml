    <History>
        This white-furred bear competes with the grizzle for the world’s largest bear. Native to only the most northern regions of the earth, polar bears are very well adapted to their cold environment. Their paws are partially covered with fur, and their guard hairs are actually hollow. The hollow, pigment-less hairs draw the heat from the sun down to where it can be absorbed by the polar bear's black skin.
        The polar bear also spends a lot of time in water. It’s front paws are large and it uses them to paddle forward. This aquatic ability is useful as while polar bears are omnivores, like all bears, their primary food source are seals.
