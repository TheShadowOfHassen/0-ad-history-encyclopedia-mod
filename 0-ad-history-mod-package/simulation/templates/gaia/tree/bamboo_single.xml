    <History>
        Bamboo is the general name of plants in the Bambusae tribe in the grass family. They are perinatal plants with a thick woody stem and long, narrow leaves. Although, they are not technically trees the larger varieties can be used almost as a replacement for lumber as they can grow up to a foot in diameter and 100 feet tall.
