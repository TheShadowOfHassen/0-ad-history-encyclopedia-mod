    <History>
        Bamboo is the general name of plants in the Bambusae tribe in the grass family. They are perennial plants with a thick, woody stem and long, narrow leaves. Although they are not technically trees, the larger varieties can be used almost as a replacement for lumber, as they can grow up to a foot in diameter and 100 feet (30.48 meters) tall.
