    <SpecificName>Aleppo Pine</SpecificName>
    <History>
       The Aleppo Pine does not look like other pines. Instead of having the distinctive triangular shape of its relatives, the Aleppo’s canopy is rather like a dome. Aleppo's height averages 65 feet (19.8 meters). It is a hearty tree that can withstand dry and windy locations and can be found in the highlands of the Mediterranean.
