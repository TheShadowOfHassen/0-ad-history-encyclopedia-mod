    <History>
       The Aleppo Pine does not look like other pines. Instead of having the distinctive triangular shape of its relatives, the Aleppo’s canopy is rather like a dome. Aleppos’ height averages 65 Feet(19.8 meters). It is a hearty tree that can withstand dry and windy locations and can be found in the highlands of the Mediterranean.
