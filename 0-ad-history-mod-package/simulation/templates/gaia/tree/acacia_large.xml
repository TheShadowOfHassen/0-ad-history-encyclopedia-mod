    <History>
        Commonly known as thorn trees, the Acacia, part of the Mimosa subfamily, grows in a variety of open habitats, varying from tropical to subtropical. While 900 of the 1,200 trees' species live in Australia, the tree is also prevalent in Africa. The Acacia lives in dry climates, so they have a deep root system in order to draw water from the ground.
        This Acacia has lived for a long time and has grown very large.
