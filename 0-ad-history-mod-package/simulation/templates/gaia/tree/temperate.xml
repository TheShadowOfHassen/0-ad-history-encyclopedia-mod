        These trees are found in temperate locations. Their verdant leaves are unfolded and the chlorophyll inside is busy converting sunlight and water into helpful sugars.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Honestly, your guess is as good as mine as to what these actuallaly are.
