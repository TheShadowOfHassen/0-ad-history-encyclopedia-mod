        Poplars(Genus Populus) are fast growing, deciduous trees of the family Salicacae. There are around 35  different kinds of the tree.
        However due to the term "deciduous", which means that the leaves fall off during  Autumn , we are unable to tell if it is dead, unless it is Spring, Summer, or early Fall.
