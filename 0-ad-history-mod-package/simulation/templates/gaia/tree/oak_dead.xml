    <History>
        The species Oak (Quercus) is one of the most recognizable trees on earth. There are many varieties of the tree from the more standard English Oak to the Holm Oak, which is an evergreen. While leaves, heights, and widths vary, one thing stays the same: the acorn. While an acorn’s size and shape may vary from tree to tree, in every form, it is the oak’s most recognizable feature.
        At first glance, this oak appears to be dead, and if it was spring, summer, or fall that would be true. However, most trees in Quercus loose their leaves in winter so if it is winter, it would be best to wait until spring to know for sure.
        Of course, if you cut it down it'll be dead either way...
