    <History>
        The African forest elephant is smaller than the African bush elephant, growing only 13 feet (4 meters) tall. While the bush elephant roams the plains, its darker-skinned relatives cut through the dense vegetation of the African forest.
        The African forest elephant’s tusks are more brown than white, and they point downward, which helps it move easily through the forest. In between its tusks is its trunk, which, thanks to two fingerlike growths on the end, can be used almost like a 5th limb to pull grass and branches, pick up logs and squirt both dust and water.
        The African forest elephant does not join herds, but they are not antisocial; they maintain contact with each other by trumpeting through the forest.
