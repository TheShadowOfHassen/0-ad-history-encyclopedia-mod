    <History>
        The African forest elephant is smaller than the African Bush Elephant growing only 13 feet tall. While the Bush Elephant roams the plains, its darker skinned relatives cuts through the dense vegetation of the African Forest.
        The African forest elephantâ€™s tusks are more brown than white and they point downward, which helps it to move easily through the forest. In between its tusks is its trunk which, thanks to two fingerlike growths on the end called processes, can be used almost like a 5th limb to pull grass and branches, pick up logs and for squirting both dust and water.
        The African forest elephant does not join into herds but they are not antisocial, they maintain contact with each other by trumpeting through the forest.
