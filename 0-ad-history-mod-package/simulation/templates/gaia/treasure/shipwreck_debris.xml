    <History>
        Sadly, sailing in the ancient world was a dangerous thing. Large storms could appear unexpected and wreck even the largest boat. This is the cargo of some unfortunate boat. The boat isn't in sight. However, the saltwater hasn't gotten into the barrels and their contents are still edible.
