    <History>
        The African bush elephant, also known as the African Savanna elephant or just the savanna elephant, is the biggest of the three elephant species, and also is the biggest land species on earth. Growing up to 16 feet tall and weighing up to 5.2 tons! It lives in the savannas and grasslands of Africa.
        Both males and females of the African bush elephant have forward curving tusks. In between its tusks is its trunk, which, thanks to two fingerlike growths on the end, can be used almost like a 5th limb to pull grass and branches, pick up logs and squirt both dust and water.
        African brush elephants live in herds, led by the eldest female, who is called the matriarch.
