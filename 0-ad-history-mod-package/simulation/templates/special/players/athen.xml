That wasn't to say that they weren't warriors. Athens at its height had one fo the most powerful navys in the ancient world and through conquring and colinizing built a vast empire.
        Ancient Athens rose and fell as an imperial power until 330 BC, when they lost the Battle of Chaeronea to King Phillip II of Macedonia. While after that it never rose again to power, Athens still was renown for its learning and its scholars were well sought out as teachers.</History>
