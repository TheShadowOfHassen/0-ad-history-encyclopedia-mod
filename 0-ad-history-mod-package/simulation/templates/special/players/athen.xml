    <History>
        The Greek city-state of Athens is remembered as a famed center for the arts, learning, and philosophy, as well as one of the earliest forms of democracy. That wasn't to say that they weren't warriors. Athens at its height had one of the most powerful navys in the ancient world and through conquering and colinizing built a vast empire.
        Ancient Athens rose to an imperial power after defeating the invading Persians twice in the early fifth century BC, and fell in 330 BC, when they lost the Battle of Chaeronea to King Phillip II of Macedonia. While after that it never rose again to power, Athens still was renown for its learning and its scholars were well sought out as teachers.</History>
