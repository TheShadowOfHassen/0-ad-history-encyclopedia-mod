Cavalry during the Hellenistic period was used in many different forms. Light mounted units were often assigned intelligence-gathering tasks. They also employed hit-and-run tactics to keep enemies busy, exhaust them, or lead them into traps. In battle, light cavalry was usually tasked with securing the infantry's flanks. When attacking, they oftentimes attempted maneuvers of outflanking, encircling, or pulling apart to open a gap in the opposing formation. And because of their speed, light cavalry was also used to pursue and kill off fleeing soldiers. 
However, due to the widespread deployment of phalangites (Macedonian pikemen) the infantry's front line was more resistant to cavalry charges than ever before. For that reason, elite cataphracts, a type of especially heavy cavalry, ascended as primary shock troops. Despite their lack of speed and maneuverability, they repeatedly won battles by exploiting gaps or weak points in the enemy's line. 
One effective and unique anti-cavalry during the Hellenistic Period were war elephants. Most horses were deterred just by the presence of elephants. Placing elephants in front of the infantry was a good way to keep enemy cavalry at bay.
