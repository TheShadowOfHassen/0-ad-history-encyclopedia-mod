Greek culture only first came into contact with elephants in the 4th century BC, during Alexander the Great's campaign, particularly in India. And, without a doubt, they were deeply impressed by these huge animals. Not only did they famously face war elephants in battle, but they also saw them employed for various working tasks.
And for the following centuries, the Hellenistic Period, elephants went on to reshape warfare and culture in the Mediterranean world: 
Elephants quickly spread all over the newly Greek populated regions and even further, from the Eastern Seleucid empire all the way to Carthage. Besides their high effectiveness on the battlefield, they were connected to strong symbolism.
Elephants were obtained either through trade with the Mauryan Empire in the Far East or caught in the wild through long and costly expeditions deep into the African continent.
Taming and training were comparably difficult due to elephants' complex social behavior. And they also required enormous amounts of food, which could be challenging and expensive to acquire and transport over long distances. 
For these reasons, the possession of elephants usually signified high prestige. A number of different Hellenistic 
monarchs bore the symbol of an elephant as a way to showcase their wealth and power. 
It was, for example, also a popular motif to be depicted on royal coinage.
