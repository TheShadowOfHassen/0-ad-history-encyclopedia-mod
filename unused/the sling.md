The sling was a weapon used by ancient peoples all around the planet, from the Chinese to the Egyptians to the Romans to the Inca, both for warfare and hunting purposes. The oldest depictions stem from the year 7000 BC, but they are thought to have been used long before that.
Slings, brimming with simplicity, were very easy and fast to produce, essentially being nothing more than a braided rope with a cradle. Projectiles were either stones collected from the ground or bullets formed from other plentiful materials, such as clay or lead.
Yet, slings were also really powerful. The simple concept of extending the arm's leverage enabled users to hurl projectiles considerably faster and further than they could otherwise. The explicit mention in the Bible that it was a sling David used to strike down Goliath underlines very well its symbolical meaning at the time: While it might have seemed like a weapon of the simple and poor at first glance, the sling was capable of humbling even the strongest men.
The only real downside of slings was the immense practice needed to learn to accurately aim. As technologically advanced weapons (with easier and more intuitive aiming) like bows or crossbows emerged, the use of slings declined. And dwindled to the few peoples with an already deep cultural connection to the sling, the prime example being the ancient Balearic people.
