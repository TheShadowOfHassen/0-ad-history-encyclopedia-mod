If you used any sources for writing a entry put it in the relevant markdown file. You don't have to put down references if you read multiple books and wrote the article from memory. However, you could put cool books you found in the general category for the civilization so other people can read them.

If you cite a website please provide a link and the artical's author (if possible) If from a book give the book's title, author and publisher.
